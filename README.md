## Data Science Projects info:    
* **A_B Test**: Perform AB test on how customers of an app react to a new feature using 2 KPIs

* **IBM Course**: Coursework for **IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science**, including a  project predicts the success rate of Falcon 9 rocket first stage landing

* **Credit Risk Model**:the project first pre-processes customer info, then uses logistic  regression to create a score card that estimate probability of default (PD). Based on this and extra data regarding EAD and LGD, we built a model to calculate probability of expected loss by:

	Expected Loss = PD x Exposure at default (EAD) x Loss given default (LGD)
