# Data Science Projects info:    
* **A_B Test**: Perform AB test on how customers of an app react to a new feature using 2 KPIs
#
* **IBM Course**: Coursework for **IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science**: including a  project predicts the success rate of Falcon 9 rocket first stage landing:

	This includes exercises on **APIs**, **dashboard-building** and classification methods (**KNN**, **Decision Tree**, **Support Vector Machine**, **Logistic Regression**)
	
	A **capstone project** that predicts the success rate of Falcon 9 rocket first stage landing (**webscrapping** and API are used to obtain data).
#
* **Credit Risk Model**:The project first pre-processes customer info (data-cleaning), then uses **logistic  regression** to build a Probability of Default (PD) model and a scorecard so the model can be easily applied a wide range of users. Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss given Default (LGD) are modelled by **beta regression**. Finally, the Expected Loss is computed as:

	Expected Loss = PD x Exposure at default (EAD) x Loss given default (LGD)
